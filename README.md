# Design Patterns

This repository showcases the core design patterns I‚Äôve learned.  
In this adventure, I followed [Robert Nystrom‚Äôs *Game Programming Patterns*](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) book through small, hands-on Unity projects.  

In each scene, you‚Äôll find example code that illustrates a pattern (such as **Command**, **Component**, **Object Pool**, etc.) both in theory and in practice.  
My goal is to show how these patterns can be integrated into games and to share the best practices I discovered along the way.  

This repo is open to anyone looking for a reference or inspiration when learning design patterns.  
You can also explore the "Sources & Assets" section for detailed information on the sources and assets I used.

<summary>Command Pattern ‚Äì Maze Replay & Undo/Redo System</summary>

## Command Pattern ‚Äì Maze Replay & Undo/Redo System

This Unity project demonstrates the **Command Design Pattern** through an interactive maze game.

The player controls a **red cube** and must navigate it across valid tiles to reach the **star**.  
Every movement is stored as a **command**, enabling two key features:
- **Undo**: Reverse the last move.
- **Redo**: Reapply a previously undone move.

When the player reaches the star, the **entire move history** is automatically **replayed**, showcasing how the Command Pattern can store, reverse, and re-execute actions.

üé• **Demo:**  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d26b3d3e-f7db-44a8-83c8-231620d9dd5b

### Features
- Movement control using the Command Pattern.
- Undo and Redo functionality for player moves.
- Automatic replay of all moves upon reaching the goal.
- Clear example of decoupling input handling from execution logic.

### How It Works
1. **Input Handling** ‚Äì Player input is translated into movement commands.
2. **Command Execution** ‚Äì The player cube moves according to the executed command.
3. **History Tracking** ‚Äì Commands are stored in a stack for undo/redo operations.
4. **Replay** ‚Äì When the star is reached, commands are executed in sequence to replay the path.

<summary>Flyweight Pattern ‚Äì Performance Comparison</summary>

## Flyweight Pattern ‚Äì Performance Comparison

This Unity project demonstrates the **Flyweight Design Pattern** by comparing two versions of a simple carrot spawning system:  
1. **Non-Flyweight Version** ‚Äì Each object holds its own unique data, resulting in higher memory usage and draw calls.  
2. **Flyweight Version** ‚Äì Shared intrinsic data between objects reduces memory usage and improves rendering performance.

The purpose of this project is to show how applying the Flyweight Pattern can optimize **memory consumption** and **batch rendering** in Unity.

</p>

### Key Takeaways
- Flyweight Pattern is highly effective for scenarios where many similar objects share common data.  
- This optimization is particularly useful for games with large numbers of repeated objects, such as bullets, tiles, or vegetation.

<summary>Observer Pattern ‚Äì Event-Driven Achievements & HUD</summary>

## Observer Pattern ‚Äì Event-Driven Achievements & HUD

This Unity scene applies the **Observer Design Pattern** to keep achievements and HUD updates **decoupled** from the event producers.  
When the player collects carrots/cauliflowers, jumps 12 times, or checks the mailbox, the relevant **achievement icon switches from grayscale to colored**, and the HUD counters update in real time.  
Progress **persists visually** even if the UI panel was closed; once opened, it reflects the correct state immediately thanks to a lightweight ‚Äúreplay on subscribe‚Äù mechanism.

üé• **Demo:**  


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2597f4fb-8082-4993-863e-3c20426cba4c


### Features
- **Loose coupling:** Producers (Subjects) and listeners (Observers) are independent.
- **Achievements:**
  - Collect **9 carrots**
  - Collect **9 cauliflowers**
  - **Jump 12 times**
  - **Check the mailbox** (press **E** near it)
- **HUD:** Carrot/cauliflower counters update instantly.
- **Visual state:** Start with **grayscale** sprites, switch to **colored** on completion.
- **Replay on subscribe:** New listeners receive the current state right away.
- **Minimal core:** `ISubject<T>` / `IObserver<T>` only; no event bus, no third-party libs.

### How It Works
1. **Subjects**
   - `JumpSubject` ‚Üí increments and notifies on each successful jump.
   - `CollectSubject` ‚Üí tracks carrot/cauliflower counts and notifies.
   - `MailboxSubject` ‚Üí one-time mailbox check, then notifies.
2. **Observers**
   - `HUDCounter` ‚Üí updates HUD texts.
   - `AchievementIcon_CollectThreshold` ‚Üí unlocks at **9/9** for the configured item type.
   - `AchievementIcon_JumpThreshold` ‚Üí unlocks at **12** jumps.
   - `AchievementIcon_Mailbox` ‚Üí unlocks on mailbox check.
3. **Replay**  
   Each Subject **replays** its current state to new subscribers so the UI shows correct progress even if the panel was previously inactive.

<summary>Prototype Pattern ‚Äì Basic Dungeon Enemy Spawner (Data Clone + Prefab Clone)</summary>
  
## Prototype Pattern ‚Äì Basic Dungeon Enemy Spawner (Data Clone + Prefab Clone)
  
This demo shows the **Prototype Pattern** in two layers:

- **Data Prototype (ScriptableObject)**: `EnemyData.Clone()` creates a **deep copy** of enemy stats.  
- **Prefab Prototype**: `Instantiate(prefab)` creates scene copies of the enemy object.

üé• **Demo:**  


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b29678f1-695b-48e5-8010-0f40f3535fde


## How It Works

1. `EnemySpawner` clones the `BaseEnemy` data prototype.  
2. `WaveModifier` applies wave-based changes (HP, speed, color).  
3. The prefab is instantiated, and `Enemy.Init(data)` injects the cloned values.  
4. `EnemyMove` uses the speed value to move the enemy towards the `Goal`.  


## Running the Demo

- Open the project ‚Üí load the `Scenes/Prototype` scene ‚Üí press **Play**.  
- The top UI shows the current wave and total spawned enemies.  

## Why Prototype?

- **Prefab** = practical prototype clone for objects.  
- **ScriptableObject** = data prototype.  
- Deep copy prevents runtime changes from affecting the original asset.

<summary>Singleton & Service Locator ‚Äì Minimal Logging</summary>

## Singleton & Service Locator ‚Äì Minimal Logging

This scene implements the **same logging task** with two patterns:
- **Singleton**: `SingletonLogger` exposes a single global instance.
- **Service Locator**: `ILog` is resolved through `Services.Log` without coupling to a concrete class.

UI: one Text element, two buttons  
- **Singleton** button ‚Üí writes via the Singleton path  
- **Locator** button ‚Üí writes via the Service Locator path  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0eaaf59-ad55-4133-84f7-159f29679a87" alt="Singleton Log Demo" width="49%" />
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fde4da64-d8ea-4847-aa12-f2b00ef0960f" alt="Service Locator Log Demo" width="49%" />
</p>

### How It Works
- On scene load, `Installer.Awake()` registers a provider: `Services.Provide(new MemoryLog())`.
- Press **Singleton**: `SingletonLogger.Instance.Write("...")` ‚Üí `logText.text = SingletonLogger.Instance.ReadAll()`.
- Press **Locator**: `Services.Log.Write("...")` ‚Üí `logText.text = Services.Log.ReadAll()`.
- If no provider is registered, `Services.Log` falls back to **NullLog** (no-op), so calls are safely ignored.

<summary>State Pattern ‚Äì Enemy AI</summary>
  
# State Pattern ‚Äì Enemy AI

This project demonstrates a grid-based enemy AI built with the **State Pattern**.  
Each state inherits from a shared base class (`EnemyState`) and follows a lifecycle of `Enter`, `Exit`, `UpdateState`, and `DecideDir`.

üé• **Demo:**  

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8c84cca-f5d7-4700-a43b-c32dae2b295f

## Behaviors

- **Wander**: Picks a random passable direction (avoids turning back if possible).  
- **Chase**: Moves toward the player, minimizing Manhattan distance.  
- **Frightened**: Moves away from the player. When entered, the enemy turns cyan. When the timer ends, the state is popped off the stack.

## Transition Rules

- The enemy starts in **Wander**.  
- After each tile step, the distance to the player is checked:
  - `dist ‚â§ chaseRangeCells` ‚Üí **Chase**  
  - `dist > chaseRangeCells` ‚Üí **Wander**  
- If **Frightened** is active, automatic transitions are ignored.  
- Collecting a big score pushes **Frightened**; when time is up, it pops.

## Movement Flow (Tile-Based)

1. The active state decides direction using `DecideDir`.  
2. `TryStartStep` checks collisions; if clear, the enemy starts moving to the target tile.  
3. `FixedUpdate` moves the enemy until it reaches the tile, then ends the step.

## Future Improvements

This project focuses on demonstrating the **State Pattern** itself.  
Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., **A\***, **BFS**, **DFS**) were intentionally left out to keep the focus clear, but they can be added later to achieve more advanced chasing and evasion behavior.
