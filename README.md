# Design Patterns


This repository showcases the core design patterns I’ve learned. In this adventure, I followed [Robert Nystrom’s *Game Programming Patterns*](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) book through small, hands‑on Unity projects. In each scene, you’ll find example code that illustrates a pattern (for example, Command, Component, Object Pool, and so on) both in theory and in practice. My goal is to show how these patterns can be integrated into games and to share the best practices I discovered along the way. This repo is open to anyone looking for a reference or inspiration when learning design patterns. You can also explore the bibliography section for detailed information on the sources and assets I used.
